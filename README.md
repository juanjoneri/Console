# Console
A "library" which allows the user to draw in the command line. Includes my own implementation of Conway's Game of Life

## Summary
Draws a matrix in the terminal and updates its entries between |  | and |X| to represent full cells *(The specific representation can be easily configured)*.
This allows for some useful and fun UI experiences inside the command line.

## Applications
In this particular case two applications were made
 * Conway's Game of Life
 * Choose the coordinates of points to draw - delete
